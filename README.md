## Setup

### Prerequisites

This progra has a few dependencies. To install them simply type:

```sh
make setup
```

### Getting final program

after installing dependencies you will be able to build a final and cross platform program. In order to achieve this, type:

```sh
nake freeze
```

or

```sh
make build
```

If you edited source code use this command to recreate the final program:

```sh
make rebuild
```

```sh
make run
```
